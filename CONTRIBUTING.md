# Contributor Policy – Controla Community Edition

This Contributor Policy governs all contributions (“Contributions”) to the **Controla Community Edition** and ensures legal clarity, project sustainability, and long-term commercial viability.

---

## 1. Purpose of This Policy

Controla follows an **open-core model**:

* The **Community Edition (CE)** is released as Open Source (AGPLv3).
* Separate **commercial / proprietary editions** exist (e.g. Hosted, Paid, Enterprise).

This policy exists to:

* protect the openness of the Community Edition
* avoid legal ambiguity around contributions
* allow the project maintainer to build and monetize Controla sustainably

---

## 2. License of Contributions

* All Contributions to the Controla Community Edition are submitted under the **AGPLv3** license.
* You confirm that you have the legal right to submit the contribution and that it does not contain third-party proprietary or restricted code.

By submitting a contribution, you agree that:

* your contribution becomes part of the AGPLv3-licensed Community Edition
* your contribution may be used, modified, and redistributed by others under the terms of the AGPLv3

---

## 3. Contributor License Grant (No CLA, but Explicit Rights Grant)

By submitting a contribution, you grant the Controla project owner a **perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free, irrevocable license** to:

* use, modify, and further develop your contribution
* use your contribution **outside of the Community Edition**
* relicense your contribution as part of **commercial or proprietary Controla offerings**

**Important:**
You retain your copyright, but you grant all necessary usage rights to enable commercial operation of Controla.

Without this explicit grant, an open-core business model would not be legally viable.

---

## 4. No Compensation or Governance Rights

* Contributions are made **voluntarily and without compensation**
* Contributors have **no entitlement** to:

    * revenue sharing
    * payment or royalties
    * influence over roadmap, pricing, licensing, or product strategy

Feedback is welcome; final decisions rest with the maintainer.

---

## 5. Scope of the Community Edition

Contributions to the Community Edition should:

* be generic, experimental, or infrastructure-focused
* avoid customer-specific or proprietary requirements
* not intentionally implement features designated as **Paid / Enterprise features**

The maintainer reserves the right to:

* reject contributions
* modify or partially adopt contributions
* move or adapt features into other Controla editions

---

## 6. No Guarantee of Acceptance

Submitting a Pull Request:

* does **not** guarantee inclusion
* may be rejected for technical, strategic, or commercial reasons

Code quality, maintainability, and product direction take priority.

---

## 7. Responsibility and Liability

* You are responsible for ensuring your contribution does not violate third-party rights
* Contributions are accepted “as is,” without warranties of any kind
* The maintainer assumes no liability for damages arising from contributions

---

## 8. Acceptance of This Policy

By creating a Pull Request or otherwise contributing to Controla, you acknowledge and accept this Contributor Policy.
